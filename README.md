# areacodes

Created a json file soley for areacode data. An example of the format for each state is below. I hope this saves someone else as much time as it did me in the future.

## Format

```
{
  "longhand": "Alabama",
  "abbrev": "AL",
  "areacodes": [
    205,
    251,
    256,
    334,
    938
  ]
}
```
